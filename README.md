***Project Overview***

*The Challenge*
Background:  In recent times, banks have moved to an online presence allowing clients to complete banking transactions completely online.  Banks that have a simple to use UI, create a seamless customer experience that make it easy for clients to withdraw and deposit from their accounts. However, poor design can lead to frustrated customers who are weary to trust their transactions with an invisible teller.

Goal: Design, build, test, and deploy a React application that allows end users to do basic online banking actions such as creating an account, logging in, making deposits and withdrawals, and viewing past transactions. 

Solution: Design a simple web application with an aesthetic UI that is straightforward for users to complete their banking activity.
